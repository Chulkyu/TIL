```
A : All right. I think we've covered all the essentials.
		Now, on to some specific matters like 'transportation'.
B : Well, what if we just put everyone in groups of 3 or 4 and carpooled?
A : Yeah, we could always do that.
C : You know, I was thinking that maybe we could rent a bus.
		You know, one of those charter buses.
A : Hmm, that would make things simpler.
B : Yeah, that's actually a good idea.
		Let's tell everybody and see what they think.
```

```
we could always do smth
 : (다른 더 좋은 방법이 없다면) 언제나 ~할 수는 있다.

Let's : ~ 하자

What if ~ : ~ 하면 어떨까?

I was thinking that maybe we could ~
 : ~ 하는 것도 방법이겠다는 생각이 들었어.
 
I think we've covered all the essentials.
 : 가장 중요한 내용은 다 얘기가 된 것 같다.

(Moving) on to : ~ 으로 넘어가서(주제, 사안)

Put everyone in groups of 3 or 4 : 3명이나 4명씩 그룹지어서

one of those charter buses : 왜 그 관광버스 같은거 있잖아.

that would make things simpler : 그러면 더 간단하긴 하겠다.
that would make things more complicated
